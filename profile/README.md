# Wynncraft Recreation
The goal of this organization is to create repositories which mimic the functionalities seen by the [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com) network. All repositories are meant for
learning purposes and are meant to show how servers like [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com) push the limits of Minecraft and software development as a whole, it's meant to aid in the learning process when it comes
to advanced programming in the PaperMC/Spigot/Bukkit community.

For more information on documentation for the resource within this organizations, you can check out our wiki here: https://wynncraft.gitbook.io/wynncraft-wiki

The repositories and logos within this organization are in no way meant to copy [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com) or steal content unlawfully, thus, there is no production server nor are there production websites running for this.
It is all strictly for learning from and I hope to give others the chance to learn and give them the reasources to that I wasn't given.
